# Starter web Vite / Preact / Typescript / TailwindCSS

This starter is based on my personal preferences and has been made to provide a template for any web application built
with Vite, Preact, Typescript & TailwindCSS. I am using Yarn and Node v15.11.0 with this starter. It comes with:

-  Prettier (and my own prettier configuration in `.prettierrc.json`)
-  ESLint (and my own eslint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`)
-  Typescript (and my own typescript configuration in `tsconfig.json`)

This starter also includes `pre-commit` as a dependency in order to run Prettier, ESLint & tsc before every commit to
make sure the code that will be pushed follows the rules defined in the configuration.
